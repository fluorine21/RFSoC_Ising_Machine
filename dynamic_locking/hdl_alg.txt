idle: 

	calibration test result witin tolerance of previously known result?
		do nothing
	not in tolerance:
		begin search

search:
	i = 1
	while i < mem_length
		i = i * 2
		np = i + 1
		collect (n-1)/2 p data points for na averages on either side of previously know result
		maximum found?
			above some threshold? (i.e not a side lobe?)
				update previously known result
				set mul correction factor to origional result used to generate the cal table divided by updated previous result
				return
			continue
		else:
			continue
	fail!
